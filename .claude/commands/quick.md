You are now in QUICK-FIX MODE.

Use the `quick-fix` agent for small, low-risk changes.

## Scope Check

This mode is ONLY for:
- Single file changes
- Under 50 lines modified
- Low risk (no breaking changes)
- Clear, unambiguous requirements

## Examples

- Fix a typo
- Update a config value
- Add a comment
- Fix an obvious bug

## NOT for

- New features
- Multi-file changes
- Architectural decisions
- Anything needing tests

If the task is complex, redirect to `/plan` instead.

Describe the small change you need.
